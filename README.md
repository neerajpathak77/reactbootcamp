## Playground for over-energetic folks
**App Repo:**        [https://github.com/neerajpathak77/reactbootcamp-chat-react-native](https://github.com/neerajpathak77/reactbootcamp-chat-react-native)

## Few pointers where you can play with app issues/refactoring/enhancements

1.  Read message count is not correct always
2.  Callbacks are used instead of promises
3.  fire.js is doing too much
4.  Mixing of concerns in code
5.  Many more bugs
6.  Can add a search component on ChatList where you can search users
7.  If you wanna go beyond react, there are lot optimizations possible in the realtime database which can solve a lot of problems, especially on mobile devices.
8.  App currently has only 2 hard code users (id 1, 2 ) who can chat together, you can make a service to create users, and then it will be a real chat app where you can search user and initiate chat.
9.  Most interesting will be this app only works if the app is open no notifications implemented, now you can go serverless and simply host a function in google cloud to send notifications to the user in case the app is closed. (Search FCM for android and APNS for iOS).
10.  Have Fun ðŸ¤¨
