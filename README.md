## Playground for over-energetic folks
This chat app is created for three reasons 
	1. This is in React Native, we all know in theory that we can use our  react knowledge in React Native. With this app I wanted to take this theory in real ground. Also this will be a small introduction to google cloud (firebase) which is very handy in mobile world but this part can be skipped totally if this doesn't feel crazy 
	2. Some of you are energetic and impatient for the things going on here. This playground is all yours
