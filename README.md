## Playground for over-energetic folks

#### This chat app is created for two reasons
1. This is in React Native, we all know in theory that we can use our react knowledge in React Native. With this app, I wanted to take this theory in the real ground. Also, this will be a small introduction to google cloud (firebase) which is very handy in the mobile world but this part can be skipped totally if this doesn't feel crazy.  
2. Some of you are energetic and impatient for the things going on so g=for you is a playground
