## What we will do here ?
### Quick Starter
You can develop the react app on any editor of your choice but I recommend you to use VSCode so that you can get quick help in case you stuck somewhere as most of us know it better.
On top of it I would recommend to install plugins 'Simple React Snippets' and 'Prettier' to your IDE those can make life a bit easy for you however it's not mandatory to work with react.

Please try to set up the starter project 
1. Install node https://nodejs.org/en/download/ 
2. Check out the branch [https://github.com/neerajpathak77/reactbootcamp/tree/quick-starter](https://github.com/neerajpathak77/reactbootcamp/tree/quick-starter)
3. Open terminal and navigate to folder 'counter-app'
4. execute command --> npm i
5. execute command --> npm run start
6. Go to browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
7. You are good to go

### Optional problem solving sessions only if needed (We can discuss some problems together or some other things like unit testing components)
#### Discuss your ideas / issues here: https://spectrum.chat/let-stalkreact-js?tab=posts

## Playground for over-energetic folks

#### This chat app is created for two reasons
1. This is in React Native, we all know in theory that we can use our react knowledge in React Native. With this app, I wanted to take this theory in the real ground. Also, this will be a small introduction to google cloud (firebase) which is very handy in the mobile world but this part can be skipped totally if this doesn't feel crazy.  
2. Some of you are energetic and impatient for the things going here. This is for you to play
